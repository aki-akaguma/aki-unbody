# Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the `aki-unbody` utility using the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax).

Each criterion is given a unique identifier (e.g., AC-01).

--- 

### Core Functionality

**AC-01: Head Extraction**
- **When** a user invokes the system with the `--head <N>` argument,
- **the system shall** output the first `N` lines from the standard input stream to the standard output stream.

**AC-02: Tail Extraction**
- **When** a user invokes the system with the `--tail <N>` argument,
- **the system shall** output the last `N` lines from the standard input stream to the standard output stream.

**AC-03: Head and Tail Extraction**
- **When** a user invokes the system with both `--head <N>` and `--tail <M>` arguments,
- **the system shall** output the first `N` lines followed by the last `M` lines from the standard input stream.

**AC-04: Inverse Extraction**
- **Where** the `--inverse` flag is present,
- **when** a user provides `--head <N>` and/or `--tail <M>`,
- **the system shall** output only the lines from standard input that are *not* part of the head or tail selection.

### System Commands

**AC-05: Help Command**
- **When** a user invokes the system with the `--help` or `-H` argument,
- **the system shall** display the full help text to standard output and exit successfully.

**AC-06: Version Command**
- **When** a user invokes the system with the `--version` or `-V` argument,
- **the system shall** display the application's version information to standard output and exit successfully.

### Error Handling

**AC-07: Missing Arguments**
- **If** a user invokes the system without providing `--head` or `--tail` (and without `--help` or `--version`),
- **then the system shall** write an error message to standard error and exit with a non-zero status code.

**AC-08: Invalid Argument Value**
- **If** a user provides a non-integer value for the `--head` or `--tail` arguments,
- **then the system shall** write an error message indicating the invalid argument to standard error and exit with a non-zero status code.

**AC-09: Broken Pipe**
- **If** the standard input stream is closed unexpectedly during processing,
- **then the system shall** exit gracefully without writing an error message.
